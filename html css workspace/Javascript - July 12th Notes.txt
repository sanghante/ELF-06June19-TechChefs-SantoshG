Brandon Eich - developed Javascript in 10 days in 1995 for Netscape.
First named as - Mocha
Later as - LiveScript
Finally as - Javascript

Javascript is a scripting language used to make the webpage dynamic. Used for client side validation.

ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Associations.
Write standard for technologies.

Javascript guys approached ECMA to make it a standard. So ECMAScript was born. 
For scripting language. ECMA 2.62 specification/

Browser doesn't understand Javascript. It uses JS Engine to interpret (execute line by line) and uses JIT to compile Javascript to machine level code.
Web browser vendors develop Javascript Engines.

Chrome uses V8 Engine => compared to other engines, this are fastest and best performing engine.
Firefox uses SpiderMonkey.
IE - Chakra.
Safari - Javascript Core.
Opera - V8 Engine.

Javascript datatypes -> boolean, String, Number, null, undefined are primitive datatypes.
It can also have reference datatypes.

String can be enclosed with " ", ' ', ` `.

var a; -> a is undefined datatype.

var a = null; -> null datatype.

ES6 has added symbol and bigint.

Reference datatypes
-------------------
Object
Array
Date
Math
Function -> is also an object in Javascript.

Objects -> real world entity having state and behavior.

object definition

var person = 
 {
	Key1 : Value1,
	Key2 : Value2,
	Key3 : Value3

	getKey1 : function() {
		return this.Key1;
	}
 }
 
 can create using new Object();

person = new Object();

person.Key1
person.Key2
person.getKey1()

or

person["Key1"];

; is not mandatory, Engine will add ; by itself.


 var fruits = ["banana", true, 1, null];
 
 fruits[0];
 
 can use new keyword
 
 var array = new Array();
 
Dates: 
var date = new Date();

Math:

Math -> +, -. *, /, %

Math.max(10,20,30,40);
Math.min(10,20,30,40);

Math.floor(4.7) -> 4;
Math.ceil(4.3) -> 5;

Math.randon() -> 0 to 1 (not inclusive)

Math.PI -> property

Math.log()

Math.eu() ?? - something to do with Euler

Function:
keyword function.

1). Named functions

function getName() {

}

2). without name -> anonymous functions or function expression.

var getAge = function() {

}

3). IIFE  -> Immediately invoked function expression , also called self invoked functions

(function() {

}());


4) Fat arrow function (similar to Java Lambdas) : ES6 feature.

() => { }

() =>  ... ;

name =>  .... ;


remind to tell difference between primitive and reference.


Primitive vs reference
-----------------------

primitive => immutable ??
reference => mutable ??


var number1=10;
var number2=10;
console.log(number1 == number2);
var str = '10';
console.log(number1 == str);
console.log(number2===str);
VM507:3 true
VM507:5 true
VM507:6 false

------------------------------

*** most functions in javascript will take call back function


let, const => ES6 new feature.

------------------
var a = 10;
var a = 20;
 a = 30;
 
 global scope;
 
-------------------
